A cross platform (Windows, Mac, Linux) desktop application for downloading Udemy Courses.

#### Project Update: 
__`I am currently not able to give this project enough time to fix the current issues or add new features. I am busy with some other projects. But I do plan to fix all the issues and add some new features. So the maintenance is temporarily on hold and this project is not dead. I also plan to make a web only version of Udeler.`__

This software does not magically download any paid course available on Udemy, you need to provide your Udemy login credentials to download the courses you have enrolled in. Udeler downloads the lecture videos by simply using the source of the video player returned to the user by Udemy after proper authentication, you can also do the same manually. Many download managers use same method to download videos on a web page. This app only automates the process of a user doing this manually in a web browser.
